# Brownies

Brownies are one of my favorite snacks! They are really delicious and can be eaten whenever. You can enjoy brownies with a scoop of IceCream or just eat them simply plain. Either way they are so yummy! 


How do you make Brownies?

Brownies are really simple to make! Just follow these simple steps and you'll have a batch of great brownies. 

Step 1:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour an 8-inch square pan.

Step 2:
In a large saucepan, melt 1/2 cup butter. Remove from heat, and stir in sugar, eggs, and 1 teaspoon vanilla. Beat in 1/3 cup cocoa, 1/2 cup flour, salt, and baking powder. Spread batter into prepared pan.

Step 3:
Bake in preheated oven for 25 to 30 minutes. Do not overcook.

Step 4:
To Make Frosting: Combine 3 tablespoons softened butter, 3 tablespoons cocoa, honey, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, and 1 cup confectioners' sugar. Stir until smooth. Frost brownies while they are still warm.

Enjoy!
